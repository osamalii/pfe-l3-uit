  "p_1" :  "   Vaccination saves millions of lives.\n        It works by stimulating and preparing the immune system to recognize and fight the viruses it targets.\n        This way, when exposed to the same pathogen in the future, the body is ready to destroy it, thus preventing disease.\n        Being a public health intervention par excellence, vaccination has demonstrated its relevance in reducing deaths\n        and disabilities caused by several infectious diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, polio, whooping cough, measles...\n        Vaccination against the COVID-19 virus represents an opportunity to ensure individual and collective/community protection.\n        This vaccine provides specific protection against the SARS-CoV2 virus, which causes COVID-19,\n        by allowing the immune system to remember the first contact with the antigen used. Upon subsequent contact with the virus,\n        the speed of recognition and the intensity of the specific immune response will prevent infection or its complications.\n        Getting vaccinated is a way to protect yourself and your family. However,\n        collective immunity will only be possible if the majority of people have been vaccinated\n        (a minimum of 80% of the population on the national territory)."
