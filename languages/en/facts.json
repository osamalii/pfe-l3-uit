  "p_1": "More than a month after the first vaccines for COVID-19, many people still have questions regarding what happens after receiving the full dose. While there is not hard data on the subject, the chances of getting and spreading the virus after being vaccinated are very low, according to one University of Alabama at Birmingham infectious disease researcher.\n\nPaul Goepfert, M.D., a professor with the UAB Division of Infectious Diseases, says the bottom line is that the vaccine most likely does not prevent spread of the virus, but probably does reduce the length of time a person sheds virus.",
  "h5_2": "Does vaccination completely prevent infection?",
  "p_2": "Does vaccination completely prevent infection?\n            The short answer is no. You can still get infected after you’ve been vaccinated. But your chances of getting seriously ill are almost zero.\n            Many people think vaccines work like a shield, blocking a virus from infecting cells altogether. But in most cases, a person who gets vaccinated is protected from disease, not necessarily infection.",
  "h5_3": "What are the side effects of the vaccine?",
  "p_3": "COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you from getting COVID-19. You may have some side effects, which are normal signs that your body is building protection. These side effects may affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects.",
